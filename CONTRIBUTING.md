Contributing
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
Reporting a bug
Discussing the current state of the code
Submitting a fix
Proposing new features
Becoming a maintainer

We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
We Use  Github FlowOpens in a new tab
 , So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use  Github FlowOpens in a new tab
 ). We actively welcome your pull requests:
Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
Ensure the test suite passes.
Make sure your code lints.
Issue that pull request.

Report bugs using Github's  issuesOpens in a new tab
 
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by  opening a new issueOpens in a new tab
 ; it's that easy!
Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
 TOpens in a new tab
 
Great Bug Reports tend to have:
A quick summary and/or background
Be specific!
What you expected would happen
What actually happens
Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People love thorough bug reports.
